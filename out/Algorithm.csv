Algorithm versus function computable by an algorithm: For a given function multiple algorithms may exist. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.The concept of algorithm has existed for centuries. Brute-force search.Some problems may have multiple algorithms of differing complexity, while other problems might have no algorithms or no known efficient algorithms. 3 Formal description+Most detailed, ""lowest level"", gives the Turing machine's ""state table"".For an example of the simple algorithm ""Add m+n"" described in all three levels, see Algorithm#Examples. In the general case, a specialized algorithm or an algorithm that finds approximate solutions is used, depending on the difficulty of the problem. One of the most important aspects of algorithm design is creating an algorithm that has an efficient run-time, also known as its Big O. Whether randomized algorithms with polynomial time complexity can be the fastest algorithms for some problems is an open question known as the P versus NP problem. Simulation of an algorithm: computer (computor) language: Knuth advises the reader that ""the best way to learn an algorithm is to try it . Techniques for designing and implementing algorithm designs are also called algorithm design patterns, such as the template method pattern and decorator pattern. An example of a decrease and conquer algorithm is the binary search algorithm. Because an algorithm is a precise list of precise steps, the order of computation is always crucial to the functioning of the algorithm."

As an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function.
Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing ""output"" and terminating at a final ending state.
An informal definition could be ""a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations"", which would include all computer programs, including programs that do not perform numeric calculations, and (for example) any prescribed bureaucratic procedure.
Such instructions are to be given quite explicitly, in a form in which they could be followed by a computing machine, or by a human who is capable of carrying out only very elementary operations on symbols.
Precise instructions (in language understood by ""the computer"") for a fast, efficient, ""good"" process that specifies the ""moves"" of ""the computer"" (machine or human, equipped with the necessary internally contained information and capabilities) to find, decode, and then process arbitrary input integers/symbols m and n, symbols + and = ...
The design of algorithms is part of many solution theories of operation research, such as dynamic programming and divide-and-conquer.
The same function may have several different algorithms"".Unfortunately, there may be a tradeoff between goodness (speed) and elegance (compactness)—an elegant program may take more steps to complete a computation than one less elegant.
For example, the subprogram in Euclid's algorithm to compute the remainder would execute much faster if the programmer had a ""modulus"" instruction available rather than just subtraction (or worse: just Minsky's ""decrement"").
Structured programming, canonical structures: Per the Church–Turing thesis, any algorithm can be computed by a model known to be Turing complete, and per Minsky's demonstrations, Turing completeness requires only four instruction types—conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment, HALT.
In modern words, remainder r = l − q×s, q being the quotient, or remainder r is the ""modulus"", the integer-fractional part left over after the division.For Euclid's method to succeed, the starting lengths must satisfy two requirements: (i) the lengths must not be zero, AND (ii) the subtraction must be “proper”; i.e., a test must guarantee that the smaller of the two numbers is subtracted from the larger (alternately, the two can be equal so their subtraction yields zero).
The following algorithm is framed as Knuth's four-step version of Euclid's and Nicomachus', but, rather than using division to find the remainder, it uses successive subtractions of the shorter length s from the remaining length r until r is less than s.
The analysis, and study of algorithms is a discipline of computer science, and is often practiced abstractly without the use of a specific programming language or implementation.
Iterative algorithms use repetitive constructs like loops and sometimes additional data structures like stacks to solve the given problems."

Such algorithms start with some solution, which may be given or have been constructed in some way, and improve it by making small modifications. For some problems they can find the optimal solution while for others they stop at local optima, that is, at solutions that cannot be improved by the algorithm but are not optimum. The most popular use of greedy algorithms is for finding the minimal spanning tree where finding the optimal solution is possible with this method. Huffman Tree, Kruskal, Prim, Sollin are greedy algorithms that can solve this optimization problem.
